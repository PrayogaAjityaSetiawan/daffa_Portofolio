## Advanced Prototyping with Figma Variables: Favorites Menu Features on the Point of Sales Dashboard

## Overview

This article tells the process of making a prototype using Figma variables, with a case study of Favorites Menu Features on the Point of Sales Dashboard. In this article, we will tell you more about the process of making a prototype based on the design exploration that I made previously.

## The Design

## Exploration Variable Prototyping Process

![Variable Prototyping Process](/explore.png)

The first thing I did when exploring Variables Prototyping was to analyze the high-fidelity design that I had previously created. After that, I marked each component that could be used repeatedly and would have interactions during the prototyping process later.

## Analyze The Hi-Fi Design

In this part, I will tell you about my process of analyzing a high-fidelity design that will later be provided with variables and components in Figma for a more advanced prototyping process.
